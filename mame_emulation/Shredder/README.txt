Using all engines of 'MessChess' in Shredder:
---------------------------------------------
1) run MAKEALL - this creates a folder 'Engines' with all necessary engine files
   (or enter "MAKEALL /name" to create engine files with full names)
2) copy this folder 'Engines' to your Shredder 'Engines' folder (for Shredder 13
   this is usually located in C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\ShredderChess\GUI13)
3) now you can immediately use every MessChess engine in Shredder

4) IMPORTANT: The GUIs own opening book MUST be switched OFF when using any
   MessChess engine!
