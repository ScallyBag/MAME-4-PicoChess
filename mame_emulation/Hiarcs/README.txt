Using all engines of 'MessChess' in Hiarcs:
-------------------------------------------
1) run MAKEALL - this creates a folder 'Engines' with all necessary engine files
   (or enter "MAKEALL /name" to create engine files with full names)
2) copy this folder 'Engines' into your Hiarcs program folder (usually this folder
   is located in 'C:\Program Files(x86)\HIARCS Chess\HIARCS Chess Explorer', which
   may require Administrator rights), or you can also use the folder 'Engines' that
   was just created in 'MessChess\Hiarcs', when you add these engines in Hiarcs
3) before you can use any MessChess engine in Hiarcs, you have to add the engine
   from the 'Engines' folder to the Hiarcs engines list

4) IMPORTANT: The GUIs own opening book MUST be switched OFF when using any
   MessChess engine!
