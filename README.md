# MAME-4-PicoChess
 
Emulating Retro Chess Computers on PicoChess
 
This will only work on pre-existing PicoChess systems running on Raspbian Buster on a RPi 3, RPi 3b+ or RPi 4b.
 
I was going to list the prerequisite Program installs required and list the actions and commands to do, but instead I'm going to create a Bash file with comments and text to explain what is being done instead.
 
 
* More to come *
 
 
Cheers,
 
       Al.
