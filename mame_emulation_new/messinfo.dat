With the Mephisto Almeria Hegener & Glaser entered new territory in many ways. Accented with a color key menu system provided despite a huge equipment for light, but anyway very basic operation. The new comfort features included a game storage for up to 50 chess games (20 with all settings such as game level or draw factor), a 32-digit very knowledgeble dot matrix display and a programmable opening book which primarily parallel was the series book can be activated. Also at the chess-playing program was created manually (source / in german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Almeria_68000).

Mephisto Almeria 68020, Hegener & Glaser Muenchen, 1988

With the Mephisto Almeria Hegener & Glaser entered new territory in many ways. Accented with a color key menu system provided despite a huge equipment for light, but anyway very basic operation. The new comfort features included a game storage for up to 50 chess games (20 with all settings such as game level or draw factor), a 32-digit very knowledgeble dot matrix display and a programmable opening book which primarily parallel was the series book can be activated. Also at the chess-playing program was created manually. The opening theory has been expanded from 40,000 half-moves (Roma) to a whopping 60000/2, while trains now made much more varied. The reflectance factor (also called the contempt factor) could now be changed in 7 steps (from -0.75 to +0.75 pawns pawns). Mephisto was the first (and as the first Richard Long Program) have now been used hash tables (and here it was not economical: 16 bits = 512 kilobytes, 32 kilobytes = 1024 bits), which contributed mainly in the final to a significant speed increase (source / in german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Almeria_68020).

In April 1992, Mephisto's black 68000 device appeared as the top-of-the-line device of the black device line. The case of the computer differs only in the lettering and in the fact that field rather than edge diodes are used by the Mephisto Milano. Also included for the Berlin are a third set of figures, miniature tiles, a "laptop lid" and lottery forms.The inside of the device features a 68000 processor with 12 MHz, which processes a slightly modified Vancouver program (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Berlin_68000).

The chess program of its predecessor, the Chess Challenger 1 has exactly 2316 bits (2 KB ROM). Challenger 3 has 2332 bits, so a minimal extension. But the most important improvement is that one can enter the moves with the usual standard notation (source: http://www.schaakcomputers.nl/hein_veldhuis/database/files/07-1977%20%5BD-8601%5D%20Fidelity%20-%20Chess%20Challenger%203.pdf).

Chess Champion: Mark VI/Philidor, SciSys, 1982

Following the initial success of the Chess Champion Mark V, Scisys were keen to follow up with a stronger program and a Sensor Board. Scisys were aware of the need to appeal to customers who preferred to play with a real chess board rather than follow the game on the LCD screen of the Mark V. Early on the Sensor Board project appeared to be going to plan. Kevin O’Connell of Intelligent Software showed a working prototype to author Tim Harding as early as August 1981. At the Second European Microcomputer Chess Championships held at the Personal Computer World (PCW) show in September 1981 two Philidor experimental programs came 4th and 5th. Development of the next program was on track. By March 1982 a price of £155 was already being quoted for the Sensor Board. A patent application was filed on 19th July 1982 (link). However the months went by with no further news of a release date. The Mark VI was released just before Christmas in 1982. The cost of the Mark V chess computer was reduced from £275 to £199, with the Mark VI module costing another £199. In January 1983 PCW carried an article about Scisys and the Mark V and VI, including a game with evaluations throughout between the old and the new. The Mark VI won OK (source: http://www.chesscomputeruk.com/html/chess_champion_mark_vi___senso.html).

Chess-Master Diamond, VEB Mikroelektronik Erfurt, 1987

The idea of the chess player Wolfgang Pähtz, uncle of the youth world champion Elisabeth Pähtz, refined Chess Masters took place at the Leipzig Messe 1987. The scope of the program memory is of 10 to 16 KB, the RAM of 2, increased to 3 KB. The display options of chess computer work during the game extremely diverse. Up to 200 half moves may be redeemed. By extension modules a total memory of 32 KB is possible. There was the opening module PM10 with approximately 800 variants and the final module PM11. The latter is after the end of the opening also recommended as a normal game module. As with its predecessor is done to detect the trains by means of Hall sensors (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Chess-Master_Diamond).

Chesster Challenger (V1.3), Fidelity Electronics, 1990

Although the Fidelity Chesster Challenger is based on the Fidelity Designer 2100 there are a number of important differences. Firstly the clock speed is 5 MHz rather than 6 MHz. The opening book is 16,000 ply and designed for variety compared with the 28,000 ply opening book of the Fidelity Designer 2100, and the narrower optimised 16,000 ply opening book of the Fidelity Par Excellence. Perhaps a more important difference is the Chesster's voice synthesizer chip and special speaker. Chesster has a vocabulary of over 300 words, which are combined into a large number of phrases. Pressing h1 at the start of the game will make Chesster go through the entire repetoire, which takes 10 minutes. The vocabulary is divided between Character Mode, Coach Mode, Demonstration Mode and Move Assistance Mode which are all selectable, individually or in combination. The vocabulary is the same as for the robot version, the Fidelity Chesster Phantom, with which it shares the 5 MHz clock speed and program. The German language version, the Kishon Chesster is believed to be based on the Designer 2000 running at 3.6 MHz. There is also a budget version called the Fidelity Little Chesster. There are two circuit boards shown in the photographs below. On the left is the Chesster Challenger and on the right the Fidelity Designer 2100 Display (source: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fidelity_Chesster_Challenger).

Master (Chess King), Chess King, 1984

Chess King is the only UK company that I am aware of which manufactured chess computers. It was initially to be a joint venture by Computer Games Ltd and Intelligent Software Ltd, but CGL dropped out and Intelligent Software, the company of David Levy and Kevin O’Connell, went it alone with Berkshire electronics manufacturer Adam Cung. Several other well known chess computers were both designed and programmed in the UK, but they were manufactured in Hong Kong. Examples include the Scisys Chess Champion Super System III and Mark V. The Chess King Master is found in small numbers only. Mainly in the UK, though this one came from Germany and has manuals in English and German. Its features include 32 edge LEDs rather than the normal 16. It contains a version of Richard Lang’s Cyrus program (source: http://www.chesscomputeruk.com/html/chess_king_master.html).

CompuChess, Data Cash Systems, 1977

Data Cash Systems Inc. also started to develop a chess computer in mid 1976. They hired independant consultants, D. B. Goodrich & Associates of Largo, Florida, for the design and development of the chess program. It is not known who the actual chess programmer was. Possibly David Goodrich himself? Suggestions that it was Peter Jennings seem to be wrong. In interviews Peter Jennings has never mentioned any involvement with CompuChess, prior to programming the Commodore Chessmate. His Microchess program was written for a 6502 based microcomputer and ported to a 8080 based microcomputer in 1977. The CompuChess has a Fairchild 3850 processor with a different architecture to the 6502 and 8080. The other early chess computer based on a Fairchild 3850 is the Chafitz Boris, which is now known to have been programmed by David Lindsey. Mike Johnson is another chess programmer known for his Fairchild chip programs. The CompuChess program was named the "Chess One-Move Calculation" program and perhaps should be acknowledged as the work of Goodrich, unless information to the contrary becomes available (source: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/CompuChess).

Constellation / Constallation 3.6 / Constellation Quattro, Novag, 1983/84/86

Externally, the Constellation presented to the public in May 1983 is designed like the Novag Sensor Dynamic. One can distinguish both devices practically only at the writing, and if someone has upgraded its sensor Dynamic with the Constellation exchange module, also this small difference does not apply. However, the proven basic program of the Sensor Dynamic has been significantly expanded and improved. Now there are more game levels (18 instead of eight), a larger compute depth (according to the manufacturer in some cases up to 24 half-moves) and a larger opening library (about 3,000 instead of 600 half-moves). The Constellation now rules all international chess rules and reclaims stalemate, draw after the 3- and 50-train rule, technical draw, chess and Matt independently. Even the elementary Matt tours with lady, with two towers, with a tower, with two runners and farmer endgames do not cause him any significant difficulties (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Constellation).

Constellation Quattro, Novag, 1986

The naming of a product is always a delicate thing, especially if this is intended for the international market, such as chess computer. At an early stage, manufacturers used terms such as Super, Turbo, Mega, Star to emphasize the special quality and performance. Another way was to specify a clear product line so that the consumer could assign the chess computer directly to a company. Known were city names at Mephisto, well-known grandmaster at Applied Concepts and gems at Novag (source translated from German: http://chess-computer.blogspot.com/2016/10/novag-quattro-forte-symphonie.html).

Diablo 68000, Novag, 1991

In 1991 Dave Kittinger finally managed to bring out its programs to 16-bit hardware, it appeared the wooden device Diablo 68000 and the technically identical hardware device Novag Scorpio 68000. The timber unit, incidentally, the last of the company Novag in this series was largely externally identical to the previous model, while the design of the plastic device has been completely revised. The Motorola 68000 used Prozessoer was clocked at 16 MHz and the program had been like when Novag Super Forte C size of 96 KB. As a novelty, but now came to the first 64K bytes for hash tables and advanced to the 16K RAM (source, translated from german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Diablo_68000).

At the same time, the Designer 1500 included the weak Chess Challenger 8 program and the Designer 2100 the very good "Par Excellence". In 1990/1991, the Excel Mach III and IV were also proposed as "Designer 2265 master" and "Designer 2325 master" (source: http://electronicchess.free.fr/heroes.html#designer2000).

Designer Mach III Master 2265, Fidelity Electronics, 1989

Anyone familiar with the usual black and gray fidelity boxes will be pleasantly surprised by the look of the Designer 2265. Its 29.5 x 29.5 x 2.6 cm plastic case with the cheekily raised corners does not catapult him into the luxury heights of a Saitek Renaissance, but is definitely neat to look at and clear enough to play games on it. The actual playing field, 20 x 20 cm in size, is equipped with pressure sensors that respond quite well to light pressure. On the side are the 16 LEDs with which the designer transmits the trains to his user. Unfortunately, the LEDs are installed below the actual surface of the designer and can only be seen through relatively tiny viewing windows. This looks elegant at first, but at the expense of clarity (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Fidelity_Designer_2265_Master).

Designer Mach IV Master 2325, Fidelity Electronics, 1991

Dan & Kathe Spracklen’s program first appeared in a 2325 USCF rated chess computer in 1989 in the Fidelity Excel Mach IV Master and Version 6 of the Elite Avant Garde. These were amongst the last Fidelity chess computers to be produced before Fidelity was sold to Hegener & Glaser, makers of Mephistos. However Fidelity largely continued operations as an independent company. The Designer board version of the 2325 was not to appear for another two years, after Sid Samole had stepped down as Fidelity president. The new management set the price of the Designer 2325 Master at a very competitive level, $500. Less than half the previous price of the Excel Mach IV. That price also included the standard issue Mephisto style case (source: http://www.chesscomputeruk.com/html/fidelity_designer_2325_master.html).

Visually, the devices are similar, but buttons and display have been brought from the front (Elite A / S) to the right and added to a second display. The program was the so-called "Elite XC", which won the open American computer championship in Mobile (Alabama) in 1985. Therefore, the device was also named "Mobile Master (6081)". On the 8bit base of the 6502 processor, the 1986 Fidelity Elite Avantgarde 2100 (6088) followed, which included a slightly redesigned par excellence program with a larger reopening library (28,000 half leads) (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fidelity_Elite_Avantgarde).

Excel 68000 Mach II (rev. C+), Fidelity Electronics, 1988

FIDELITY MACH II is an improvement on the original FIDELITY EXCEL 68000, mainly due to an increased RAM of 144K that comprised of 16K static RAM and 128K dynamic RAM which was used for Hash Tables. The original FIDELITY EXCEL 68000 only had 16K RAM. This resulted in a playing strength increase of around 60 ELO for the MACH II (source: http://www.spacious-mind.com/html/mach_ii_c__l_a__version.html).

The Par Excellence, Fidelity Electronics, 1986

In the advertising referred to as a price-performance monster, the Par Excellence offered in fact an excellent price-performance ratio. For a fraction of the price of a Fidelity Elite avant-garde, a device was available that even surpassed the avant-garde's gaming strength. You had to accept a simple plastic version in a color-accustomed case, which gave Par Excellence the top name "Oxenfrosch" (source, translated from the German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fidelity_Par_Excellence).

Prestige Challenger (original program), Fidelity Electronics, 1982

At the 8th Porz Open chess tournament from 14.8.1982 - 22.8.1982 the Fidelity Prestige won 3.5 points out of 9 games and achieved an ELO number of 1660 points. This value is surprisingly exactly the same as the 1661 points later determined by the SSDF. This device was the flagship in 1982, the absolute non-plus ultra from Fidelity Electronics. Technically, it is largely identical to the Fidelity Elite A / S, but in appearance it differs from this one by more sophisticated styling. As prestigious as the Prestige looks, it remains a chess computer that does not just want to be admired, it's also there to play. Of course, Fidelity also took this view, otherwise it would not have been provided with the same modular system as the Fidelity Sensory 9 and the Fidelity Elite A / S, and the opening module Fidelity PC 16 would be added at the same time. Thus, at the beginning of the game, 1,345 variants of the most important openings are available, which effectively lead to about 26,900 positions. A special game mode even allows practicing these variants. Modules for general and special openings, middlegame improvements, finals, lightning chess, championship games, special matriculation grades for problem composers and the like were launched over the years (sh fidelity modules), then a maximum depth of 32 half-moves in the analysis and matte search stage and two special programs for iterative and non-iterative search (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Fidelity_Prestige).

Sensory Chess Challenger 12-B, Fidelity Electronics, 1984

Fidelity model no. 6086. It gives me so far not entirely clear what the exact technical difference with the standard version of the Challenger 12. Who knows may say, but please substantiate the facts. From my disposal literature I am none the wiser, in fact, I get ascended information provided. Sometimes I read the Challenger 12 B has a 4 MHz CPU, but other sources contradict this again. Personally, I love it (for now) at 3 MHz. does this Sometimes a version (significantly) improved Budapest program? Or had improved (internal) opening book? This version was sometimes hardware improved? The exact release date remains an open question. A fact is that Fidelity whopping released two optically different models of the Challenger 12 B. My main indication that the Challenger 12B a 3 MHz CPU possession, I tap with a short message from the Computer Chess Digest Supplement (source, translated from Dutch: http://www.schaakcomputers.nl/hein_veldhuis/database/files/11-1984%20[C-0376]%20Fidelity%20-%20Sensory%20Chess%20Challenger%2012%20B%20(3%20MHz%20edition).pdf).

The successor model of Sensory 8 has a modified library, which is also found in later models. The game levels were streamlined as well as the game strength. The ROM is located in a module, similar to the Sensory Mini. However, it is not compatible with other devices. Also, no other modules are running in the Sensory 6, only 2 specially designed for him on the market (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fidelity_Sensory_Chess_Challenger_6).

One feature I like on this unit that even some modern ones don't have is the ability to turn off the beep or it can be set to signal only the computer's move. It thinks on the opponent's time. Hint feature and a book practice mode where it will play any line in the book, not just the good ones. This was a very important machine because of its strength and it also had the ability to use different modules that you could purchase separately (source: http://www.ismenio.com/chess_sc9.html).

Mephisto Genius 68030 London Upgrade, Hegener & Glaser Muenchen, 19??

At that time, the first relatively low-cost 32 bit module set with a program of Richard Long. The significantly slower 68020 predecessor modules cost about 2000€. The program was also an EPROM upgrade for some older models. The Genius 2.0 program of the best according to many experts, chess programmer Richard Lang in November 1993 could win the world title. Originally conceived as a pure computer program, decided to make the German manufacturer Hegener & Glaser, this program also tip the owner of the modular boards accessible. The operation of the computer cursor is controlled using a model system, only six buttons (source, translated from german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Genius).

Great Game Machine, Applied Concepts, 1980
Chess modules: Boris-Sargon 2.5 / Sandy Edition / Steinitz Edition-4

This Great Game Machine is with 2 modules: the Sargon 2.5 and the Morphy. Today, the Great Game machine looks like a museum piece, with its basic keyboard, its led display and its high price. But at that time, those like me who saw it coming in the shops were fascinated. It was modular but the modules were to expensive. Still today, its game style is very nice and it defends well at level "2 to 4 mn per move" (source: http://electronicchess.free.fr/index-UK.html#ggm).

Mephisto III S Glasgow, Hegener & Glaser Muenchen, 1984

The 4th World Microcomputer Chess Championships were held at Glasgow in September 1984. Nineteen programs took part and first place was shared between the Psion program of Richard Lang, the Princhess program of Ulf Rathsman, Spracklens latest Fidelity version and a program called Mephisto Exclusive S. In fact three versions of Elmar Henne and Thomas Nitsche's Mephisto program competed on machines equipped with 68000 processors running at 12 MHz. Mephisto had both numerical and hardware advantages over their main opposition (source: http://www.chesscomputeruk.com/html/mephisto_iii-s_glasgow.html).

Computer Chess (Mattel), Mattel, 1980

I knew Mattel Electronics Computer Chess was a remarkable game. In fact, I was so confident it was one of the best electronic chess games, I encouraged Mattel Electronics to challenge their leading competitor Fidelity Electronics Sensory Chess Challenger’ “8”, to a match. And as it turned out, my expectations were well founded. In more than 100 games, Mattel Electronics’ Computer Chess beat Fidelity's game 62% of the time (Games were played at highest regular game level for each). Computer Chess was programmed by International Chess Master Julio Kaplan, resulting in a game that plays more like a real person than a machine. It is portable and pocket sized, and has no separate pieces to lose. Both the chessboard and the pieces are represented by a large easy-to-read liquid crystal display. And the game's three playing modes provide a variety of game play for the newcomer as well as the experienced player. If chess is your game, I highly recommend you make your next move to Mattel Electronics Computer Chess. But don’t just take my word for it, compare for yourself. Once you do, I think you’ll choose Computer Chess. The game that checkmates the leading competitor (source: http://www.spacious-mind.com/html/computer_chess.html).

In 1984, Hegener & Glaser managed to add the programmer Richard Lang, known for having just won the World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCCC) with his software for Psion. In the same year Thomas Nitsche and Elmar Henne participated in the WMCC with the Mephisto III-S Glasgow, which ranked first among the dedicated chess computers. Richard Lang won the next six WMCCs (1985 - 1990) with the Mephisto brand, thanks to the Amsterdam, Dallas, Rome, Almeria, Portorose and Lyon models, thus making Hegener & Glaser the largest and most famous manufacturer of electronic chessboards of the years 80. In 1989, Hegener & Glaser purchased Fidelity Electronics, which had since become in crisis, but Fidelity's debts and market contraction soon led to Hegener and Glaser, who had to sell their company to Saitek Ltd.

Although the printer or TV interface never appeared on the market, it did, however, launch a new program in December 1981. The Mephisto II program was twice as large (16 KByte), had a much larger opening repertoire (4,000 half-trains instead of 220) and was also considerably stronger. After all, it was the world champion of Travemünde, the Mark V, superior. Only after a few months had it beaten the new Fidelity stars Sensory 9 and Prestige, although it could defeat the Prestige even in a sensational show fight under the supervision of a Bundesliga referee. Here is not flawless, but quite nice lot (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_II).

Mephisto ESB II, Hegener & Glaser Muenchen, 1981

With ESB II, the program module for the Mephisto II basic unit was called, which enabled the control of the magnetic sensor boards ESB II, ESB 3000 and ESB 6000. The first version is i. W. the program Mephisto II with from 300 to 350 variants increased opening library and was brought simultaneously with the simple Mephisto II basic unit Christmas 1981 on the market. It ran like the Mephisto II with a 3.5 MHz basic unit. With the introduction of the 6.1 MHz basic units (briquette), a new ESB IIb module was launched, which runs in the boards ESB 3000/6000. In this module, the software should be improved again, especially the Enspielverhalten. This version can also be found in the later Mirage module. ESB II was also the first magnetic sensor board (similar to the Mephisto ESB 6000) of Mephisto called. In contrast to the ESB 6000, the module was built into the board and only modules of the first series are running with a sticker on the back, so the board control is not compatible with the ESB 3000/6000. The Mephisto ESB II clock rate was initially 3.5Mhz, and later, after the introduction of the 6.1MHz briquette, even older 6.1MHz ESB IIs were sold off. From the ESB 3000/6000 all variants had 6.1 MHz (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_ESB_II).

Mephisto III, Hegener & Glaser Muenchen, 1983

The memory module of the predecessor Mephisto II (left, inside view of the III module type b) also works in the Mephisto III basic unit. And vice versa, of course! However, there seems to be newer III basic devices in which the II module is not working properly. Also interesting is the fact that in some later III basic devices the processor 1806 was installed instead of the 1802. The Mephisto III program can also be found in the insert Mephisto MM I for the Modular series. The main difference was the use of the 8 MHz processor 1806. There are 2 versions of the Mephisto III program: the former version III a contains a bug in the problem solving level. Only version III b is actively playing e4 e6 in the opening. You can also differentiate the versions with a look at the opened program module: the a-version is stored in 2 EPROMs, the B version is in a ROM (the 2 additional blocks are RAMs, ie the modules contain 4 or 3 chips). Upon request, the newer basic devices of Mephisto II or Mephisto III (6.1 MHz versions) could be converted to 12 MHz, but then ran only with IIIer module. For this purpose, the processor CDP 1802 was replaced by a CDP 1805 and the on-board electronics were slightly modified (supply voltage increased during mains operation). When battery powered, these devices run as usual at 3.5 MHz. Instead of the 6.1 MHz version typical about 1.8 positions / s comes a 12 MHz briquette to about 3.4 positions. For comparison, a Mephisto MM I 8 MHz creates 2.3 positions, while a Mephisto III-S Glasgow (68000, 12 MHz) manages (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_III).

The program of the Mephisto Milano is based on the Mephisto Polgar and contains additional tactical algorithms of Mephisto MM V and its own kind of extensions (in this case extensions for chess bids that go beyond the normal level), which should vouch for the skill level of its predecessor to surpass even a lot. Impact of these extensions is the following position very clearly, the Polgar needed over 20 minutes for Matt, it is for Milan in a matter of seconds (source: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Milano).

Mephisto MM I, Hegener & Glaser, 1983

The Mephisto III program can be found here in the insert Mephisto MM I for the modular series again. The main difference to the Mephisto III was the use of the 8 MHz processor 1806. Like the Mephisto III there were at least 2 ROM versions ("A" and "B") on the MM I. Version "a" occupies both ROM slots on the board, with version "b" a slot was left empty (see fig.). There are also modules in which the socket for the 2.EPROM is no longer available. To the programmatic differences regarding "a" and "b" see Mephisto III (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_MM_I).

Mephisto MM IV, Hegener & Glaser, 1987

"MM IV" - the name is not very successful, but I always prefer names like "Forte", "Rebel" or "Leonardo" to the dry Roman numerals. Also, surely all world will speak of "Mephisto MM IV", which is actually wrong, because one "M" already stands for "Mephisto" (and the second for "Modular"). Accordingly, the "Mephisto Modular IV module" has been released, which is delivered in the well-known Modular, Exclusive and Munich devices, but it can also be operated in the mobile version. The new Hegener & Glaser program comes from Ed Schröder and has been further developed from the rebel. It is to be feared that just as at the time when the "B + P module" was followed shortly after its launch by the "MM IV", this time also many rebel buyers will be annoyed about the rapid obsolescence of their device Dave Kittinger once told me that chess computer business downtime is tantamount to regression (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_MM_IV).

Mephisto MM V (V5.1), Hegener & Glaser, 1990

In 1990, the Mephisto MM V program appeared on the market and is still one of the most popular modules! There are several reasons: Firstly, it is the last module of Hegener and Glaser, which can also be operated in the mobile and thus Mephisto "pocket-portable" is. Secondly, it is because of his playing style. But the program itself has other undeniable qualities: failed the narrow opening repertoire for which a circumference of 8000 half moves is specified. But at least all transpositions are detected. To compensate you can access opening to the HG 550 module that expands the scope of nearly 20,000 half moves, but in the mobile / slot can not be operated (source, translated from german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_MM_V).

Mephisto Modena, Hegener & Glaser, 1992

The Modena is the weakest device from the laptop design series from Mephisto. The program comes from Frans Morsch and seems to include version 2.05 of the well-known Dominator program. It has some peculiar peculiarities, for example, if one wishes to take back the long Rochade with TAKEBACK, it is first correctly asked to place the king from c1 to e1; but he will have placed the tower from d1 to g1. The self-test is also started with the same key combination, as with the Dominator: Press and hold the springer and pawn buttons, then the display shows "Test". With the Dominator you can now read the version number in the second display; since this is missing at Modena, the version is unfortunately not recognizable with him (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Mephisto_Modena).

Nona won in 1985 in Amsterdam, then still running on an Apple IIe, superior with 7 points from 7 games, the World Cup title in the amateur group. The second-placed Rebel found his way into the modular series after the 85er WM (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Mondial).

Mephisto Mondial 68000XL, Hegener & Glaser, 1988

In order to gain a foothold in the predominantly Fidelity-dominated US market, Hegener & Glaser launched the 16-bit variant of the Mephisto Dallas World Championship program in the Mondial case at a low price of $ 399 at the time. A sale in Europe was not intended, but the Mondial 68000XL was then distributed in Germany. There is an original German BDA. In most German copies minus is located at the power input socket inside, as in the US version, but there are also copies with plus inside. Unfortunately, there is no label on the outside of the power supply connector, but a good reverse polarity protection protects the device (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Mondial_68000XL).

Mephisto Montreux, Saitek / Hegener & Glaser, 1995

Montreux, the small town on Lake Geneva, was the name of the Mephisto computer of the same name. "If you want peace of mind, come to Montreux," Freddie Mercury once asked the world. Why, however, this chess computer has been given the name of Montreux, will always remain a secret of the company Hegener & Glaser (Saitek), because this device can not contribute to the peace of the soul. His costume consists much more in mocking this with his aggressive style. Behind the black plastic sheath hides an ARM6 32Bit RISC processor, which is powered at 14 MHz. Furthermore, 128KB RAM is available for thought support. The unit is controlled by 17 buttons, which are located on the right side. The figures are set by pressure sensors or animated by the 16 edge LEDs for setting. Perhaps these factors are inter alia. Responsible for the fact that the Montreux never brought it to a real collecting room. The entire exterior (washboard design) is as simple or if one were malicious, to call cheap. In addition there is the time of the creation. The Montreux dates from 1995. A time, as we all know, in which the rushing PC wave rinsed almost all chess computers. In short, the Montreux just came too late to get a few more laurels (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Mephisto_Montreux).

MEPHISTO Risc II came out in 1994. The program is written by Ed Schroeder and is the same program that won the Hardware Division of the 1992 World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC) in Madrid, Spain. The actual program that won 1992 WCCC championship was the TASC B. V. Chessmachine card with the program Gideon version 3.1 Madrid. This program was made available as a module for the MEPHISTO modular range of chess computers in 1994. The processor is an ARM2 RISC processor running at 14 MHz with 128 KB ROM and 1024 KB RAM. The build-in opening book comprises of approximately 80,000 half-moves. The Risc II module works with the MEPHSITO Exclusive and Muenchen modular chessboards (source: http://www.spacious-mind.com/html/module_risc_ii.html).

The program in the Mephisto Polgar 10MHz is the same as the standard Polgar (5MHz) but running exactly twice as fast. The Polgar 10MHz modules were only issued by Mephisto in suitably adapted Modular or Exclusive boards. The Modular combination cost £749 in the UK, and the Exclusive £879. They both came with a stern warning not to attempt to use the modules in other boards or to use the adapted boards with other types of module. The orange notice (pictured below) warns that only the enclosed Polgar 10MHz modules work with that board because of changes made in the electrical supply. All other modules which normally run with the board may be destroyed (or words to that effect) (source: http://www.chesscomputeruk.com/html/mephisto_exclusive_polgar_10_mhz.html).

Mephisto Portorose 68000, Hegener & Glaser, 1989

One year had passed since the Micro-World Championship in Almeria, Spain, and the new battlefield was called Portorose (today's Slovenia). Hegener & Glaser (Mephisto) had set the same success duo Richard Lang / Ossi Weiner - just as it turned out. Everything should be, and measured against the high expectations, it was also better. The "new" came mainly with a "commercial hardware", which had in itself: a Motorola 68030 with 36 MHz, 2 megabytes for hash tables, to get "favorable" 15,000 DM. Standard mortals were allowed a.) Almeria `S for conversion to Munich or b.) With the" favorable "68020 (32 Bit) + 68000 (16 Bit) modulesets. Since no commercial opponent could be found on the ground in the World Championship, Mephisto got this title without a fight.

Mephisto Portorose 68020, Hegener & Glaser, 1989

One year had passed since the Micro-World Championship in Almeria, Spain, and the new battlefield was called Portorose (today's Slovenia). Hegener & Glaser (Mephisto) had set the same success duo Richard Lang / Ossi Weiner - just as it turned out. Everything should be, and measured against the high expectations, it was also better. The "new" came mainly with a "commercial hardware", which had in itself: a Motorola 68030 with 36 MHz, 2 megabytes for hash tables, to get "favorable" 15,000 DM. Standard mortals were allowed a.) Almeria `S for conversion to Munich or b.) With the" favorable "68020 (32 Bit) + 68000 (16 Bit) modulesets. Since no commercial opponent could be found on the ground in the World Championship, Mephisto got this title without a fight. But just - in the software group, the spoiled serie victor was able to cross the blades and show what improvement he had against his predecessor. It will not surprise anyone when it is said that the game of the Portorose is still to be characterized as a positional calm. The already comprehensive opening library was again expanded (from approx. 60,000 to approximately 85,000 half-berths). The equipment has been rounded off (some "unsettled" of the menu system have been improved, including, in particular, the position input), 3 selectable play styles introduced (risk, active (basic setting) and solid).

During the tournament rebel had several competitors that ran on mainframes, beaten and impressively in the last round, the chance to win with a victory over the American program Be-Be for the world title.

Savant, Novag, 1981

On the occasion of the Nuremberg Toy Fair in 1981, Novag introduced its new chess computer product range to a small circle of chess journalists for the first time. The basis for this was the chess program Mychess by the author David Kittinger. For the development, the technical design and the elegant shaping the company California R & D was responsible. The Savant, the flagship of the company, you could buy about 4 weeks before the 2nd World Cup 1981 in Travemünde already in stores. The baptism of fire in the 2nd World Cup did not turn out to be as happy as expected. In group B - commercial microcomputers - the Savant finished third behind the winner Mark V (8.5 pts) and the runner-up Champion Sensory with 6.5 points with a total of 6 points. With the 8K extension module, the buyers of the Savants were able to convert their device to the Savant II in just a few simple steps. Here were then also some small program inaccuracies eliminated (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Savant).

Savant II, Novag, 1982

This device was the direct successor of the well-known Savant, which was created by adding an expansion module of eight kilobytes. If you already had a Savant, you could purchase this extension module and upgrade your device with it. A special feature is the type of train input and output: The output is on an integrated LCD board, the input is made by the fact that you can move your own figures by tapping the appropriate fields. This is made possible by the fact that there is a transparent pressure sensor foil above the LCD board. Overall, the Savant II excelled by its excellent technical equipment and its modern design. What sets him apart from the Savant Royale is the lower computational speed alone. Otherwise, the Savant II already offered in the basic version 16 stored master games, which could be extended over the module system to 64 more games, eight game and two analysis levels, Permanent Brain and the application of all draw rules. Internally, the device has a capacity of 48 kilobytes, of which only 32 are used by default (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Savant_II).

In 1991, Dave Kittinger finally managed to bring out his programs on 16-bit hardware, it appeared the Novag Diablo 68000 wooden device and the hardware-identical device Novag Scorpio 68000. The design of the plastic device was completely redesigned, it was still black but the optics was in favor of round Shaped forms. The basic design has been retained to this day in the successor devices Novag Diamond (black), Novag Diamond II (gray) and Novag Star Diamond (gray). The used Motorola 68000 processor (soldered in) was clocked at 16 MHz and the program, like the Novag Super Expert C, had a size of 96 KB. As an innovation, however, 64 KB for Hash Tables and 16 K extended RAM were added for the first time. Circuit board of the Novag Scorpio 68000. One likes about the innovation strength of 24 z. T. doubly occupied keys argue, but in terms of equipment both devices are the chess computer with the largest ever released by Novag range of functions. After all, the most important functions can be accessed via the 8 buttons on the far right (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Scorpio_68000).

Super Expert (version C, V3.6), Novag, 1989

The units of the Super Forte/Expert series appeared in 1987 with the program version A, 1989 the release of version B. The development culminated in the C version in 1990, the same time, this was also the last 8-bit unit of the company Novag, then it rose to 16-bit technology in the form of the Motorola 68000 CPU at (Novag Diablo Scorpio 68000 and 68000). The Novag Super Forte had virtually the plastic housing of the predecessor Novag Forte (though completely in black) during the Super Expert was a new creation made of wood, which was based on the Novag Constellation Expert. Especially the wooden device was a feast for the eyes and is still today one of the most beautiful chess computers that have ever been built. The devices were quasi modular, they were but by simply opening the case and replacing the EPROMs converted to the latest version. The clock was first 5 MHz, Version B was also the conversion to 6 MHz offered (source, translated from german: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Novag_Super_Expert_C).

Mephisto Super Mondial, Hegener & Glaser, 1986

The successor of the Mephisto Mondial II now has a whopping 8 KB RAM as well as 32 KB ROM and runs at twice the clock frequency. Thanks to the two LCD displays, he informs the operator of all the important search information - the main variant is 6 half-berths, addiction depth, position evaluation, the train currently being examined, the number of trains and train times. In addition, the Super Mondial shows the current game phase, divided into opening, center game and final game (open-midg-endg). The Super Mondial has very easy-to-use pressure sensors, the function buttons are clearly arranged and speak just as easily, the play style is rather positional, without falling into the tactical range, the end game behavior must be described as weak. There are several program versions (called versions A, B and AB) of the Super Mondial, which can be identified in different ways: The figures above show two different possibilities: - The versions A and AB have the name at the upper left edge of the playing field, the signature over the two displays (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Mephisto_Super_Mondial).

Mephisto Super Mondial II, Hegener & Glaser, 1988

Optionally, the SuperMondial II can be retrofitted with the so-called college module, which is inserted in the area of the battery compartment. The functions of the Super Mondial II do not change, the module is only an extension, on the EPROM there are about 8 KB of data. After the module is installed, the tutor mode is available, this includes 100 exercises, 64 opening variants for training and the HELP function. The HELP function warns of threats during a game, points to weak moves, and makes suggestions for improvement. This function is not implemented in the related Monte Carlo IV and Monte Carlo IV LE brothers and the college module works in these devices also not. The devices sold as a college version had the coordinate printed on each field. With the College Module plugged in, the SuperMondial II will report "College" when it is switched on (source, translated by German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_Super_Mondial_II).

This is a modular chesscomputer, similar to Mephisto's 3-drawers one. Chesscomputer on the right, LCD in the middle, and future expansion on the left. The only difference between 40 and 50 is the board size (40cm vs 50cm). The chess engine is Cyrus 68K, by Mark Taylor, with advice from David Levy. It's not related to the Z80 version of Cyrus, only by name. This chessboard was also used on the Sphinx 40 / 50 Plus, which is another incarnation of Frans Morsch's Dominator program.

Super Sensor IV, Novag, 1981

NOVAG SUPER SENSOR IV offers you a deep and well researched book opening library of 600 half moves which combined with our strong random generator assures lots of variety in your games. SET LEVEL BUTTON: Choose play strength. TIME CONTROL BUTTON: Choose time control. The NOVAG SUPER SENSOR IV has 8 play levels in which the level 1 is the weakest and level 8 is the strongest. A further option which plays a factor in the search depth of the computer is the Time Control as explained below. The higher the play level the longer it takes for the computer to make a move but the computer will analyze the position and the moves in more depth which will influence the strength of his reply. The NOVAG SUPER SENSOR IV also uses your move time and continues to analyze positions while you ponder your next move (this is also called Permanent Brain). In addition to the 8 play levels, the computer also has 2 time control options available for use in which variable or fixed response times can be set up. If the variable option is used the computer will move more quickly in simple game situations but it will also use more time in more complex positions. The levels 7 and 8 will be used for analysis or the solving of special chess problems. If the fixed option is used, the computer will make its move only after the time allocated by the level choice is used. In the fixed option the levels 6, 7 and 8 are tournament play levels (source: http://www.spacious-mind.com/html/super_sensor_iv.html).

But I think I did for the unit with printer and LCD panel with approximately 600.00€ not much besides lying. Euro has cost / with the base unit 200.
